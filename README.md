## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My topic/interest is in aerospace engineering, specificly in aerodynamics. 
I want to learn more about computational fluid dynamics and perform flow simulations for airplane designs.
A specific research topic I am interested in aerodynamics is about methods controlling the flow of air over an airplane's wing
to delay the transition between laminar-to-turbulent flow. One of the proven effective method for flow control is by using plasma actuators.
The motivation behind this research is in sustainable avaiation. By reducing the drag over airplane's wings, it would improves the aerodynamics of an airplane and help increases its fuel efficiency.
A study by Schrauf(2005) estimates that the overall drag of a current civil airliner could reduced by up to 16% if the flow over 40% of the wings and tails plane was laminar. 
According to the International Civil Aviation Organization's(ICAO) annual global statistics, the number of global flights reached 38.9 millions in 2019.
Data from recent years show that the airline industry is responsibles for 12% of transportation CO2 emissions.
With the airplane travels becoming more essential and more widely used, this research could help fight climate change by reducing fuel consumption of each airplane flight.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My dataset is the engineering job listings in the US. The dataset source is from glassdoor, a popular job listing site based in the US, 
showing the information of the job and the company by taken surveys from previous, current, prospect employees.
The dataset consist of the job title, estimated salary, rating level of this job, job description, whether or not it's easy to apply to, company name, location of the job, 
the headquarter locations of the company, size of the company, the company's revenue, the company competitors, and the founded date of the company. 
The dataset also categorizes the company by the type of company it is, its indutry, and sector it is in. 
This dataset was intented to help people better find the job and company that is most suited from their set of skills and personal preferences.
This dataset could also provides a visualize of the correlations between the job salary, the job rating level, and the company.
This dataset was last updated in 2020
